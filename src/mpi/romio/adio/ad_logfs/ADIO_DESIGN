* Independent vs collective open

  LogFS cannot reuse the existing file handle, since it is unable to set the
  view in a reliable way from an independent call. (Which could be needed for
  example, if an independent replay is needed)

  For now this would work, since ADIO_Set_view only modifies some AD_File
  variables; However, for the new two phase, if I'm not mistaken, their was
  some communication on set_view to precalculate some data.

  The real questions:
      1° Is ADIOI_Set_view collective or not? (in ALL ADIO drivers?)
      2° What about independent open? What about a replay on a CPU that didn't
      yet open the file?


* Difficult (for the layering):
  ADIO_Open doesn't have the MPI_Info even though MPI_File_open has it;
  -> at open time the info is not available; only afterwards set_info
     is called

* Strange:
    -> ADIOI_xxx_SetInfo is called BEFORE ADIOI_xxxx_Open is called!
         annoying, because ADIOI_xxx_Open can allocate the
         fs_ptr structure (which might be used to store the hints)
         however, it is only allocated on ADIOI_xxx_Open!

    As a consequence, FS-specific data has to be in the general
    ADIO_Fd structure (See union in ADIOI_Hints_strict );

    Also, not calling ADIOI_Gen_SetInfo makes open crash
    (because hints->cb_config_list remains 0 and ADIOI_cb_config_list_parse
    assumes it is not 0 )

* Uses_generic_read | write

  -> should use properties / flags / ... instead of function addrs



* data sieving:
   For example, adio_open ("shared" function)
   plays with access_mode (lies about it) just to be able to do data sieving
   -> means that PVFS2 files in wr-only mode are also always openend in rdwr
   mode, even though not needed
